# 6502_Emulator_2025
Another attempt at a 6502 Emulator. This is very much a work in progress.

## Purpose
To create a reasonably accurate emulator of the 6502 processor, which helped kick off the personal computer revolution. In the process, improve python coding skills and understanding of 6502 machine language.

## How to Run
Download the repository. Execute the Python file called system.py. The actual CPU code is in the file 6502_cpu.py.
